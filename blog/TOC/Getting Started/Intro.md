# 🏠 Introduction to `@fizzwiz/prism`

`@fizzwiz/prism`  introduces **algorithmic patterns** and **very basic ideas** to resolve the essence of complex computational problems, breaking them down into manageable and elegant structures.

## 📌 The Challenge of Complexity

Many computational problems explode in size or complexity, making naive exploration impractical.
`@fizzwiz/prism` provides powerful abstractions to tame **large and intricate candidate spaces**, enabling efficient, structured, and readable exploration without losing clarity.

## 🎯 The Search-and-Select Pattern

At the core of `@fizzwiz/prism` is the **Search-and-Select Pattern**, a strategy for exploring and ranking solutions.

In this pattern:

* A **search space** is modeled by the `What` class.
* A **search** is expressed via the `Each` class, providing lazy iteration.
  (Both come from the companion library [`@fizzwiz/fluent`](https://fluent.blog.fizzwiz.cloud))
* A **priority queue** manages candidate ordering, ensuring efficient selection.

## 🧠 Capturing the Wonder

The essence of `@fizzwiz/prism` is **capturing the wonder** — the spark that transforms a seemingly intractable problem into a solvable one. Each abstraction, from `Search` to `PopRace`, embodies this principle:

* **Search** explores large solution spaces lazily, focusing only on the paths that truly matter.
* **PopRace** converts exponential candidate growth into manageable linear steps, making combinatorial exploration feasible.

Beyond the algorithms, `@fizzwiz/prism` emphasizes a **fluent, intuitive syntax**. Developers can articulate complex computational logic naturally, concentrating on the *logic of discovery* rather than mechanics like iteration, queuing, or ranking. This approach combines elegance, clarity, and efficiency.

In essence, `@fizzwiz/prism` illuminates computational insight, turning moments of discovery into **actionable, reusable solutions**, much like a prism reveals the hidden spectrum within light.
