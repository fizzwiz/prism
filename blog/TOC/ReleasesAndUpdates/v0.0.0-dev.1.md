# 📦 v0.0.0-dev.1 — Search and Run

We’re thrilled to announce the **first prerelease** of `@fizzwiz/prism`: **v0.0.0-dev.1** — the *First Brick*, laying the foundation for a library dedicated to **capturing the wonder moment** of calculi.

This release unveils the core abstractions: `Run` and `Search`.
Each abstraction serves as the cornerstone for its own package, offering expressive, high-level problem-solving patterns.

Notably, the `Search` class introduces full support for the [Search-and-Select Pattern](https://blog.fizzwiz.cloud/2025/06/search-and-select-pattern.html), enabling formal and symbolic exploration of infinite solution spaces. 

> 🧪 This is a **prerelease**, ready for exploration. Your early feedback is invaluable and will help shape the API’s evolution and future features.
